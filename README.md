A virtual machine based of the Maurer Machine, as described in *Compiler Design: Virtual Machines* by Wilhelm and Seidl. In addition to the features described in the book, this implementation supports sum datatypes and mutable reference. Also, it provides its own two-space copying garbage collector.

It runs bytecode generated by the [MaMaCompiler](https://github.com/kevinclancy/MaMaCompiler/tree/to_rust) project. There are some example programs in the examples subdirectory. To run the Factorial example, type
```
cargo run -- examples/Factorial.bin
```
